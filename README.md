# networkPentestingTools
A repository of different tools I'm building in Python.  They are all optimized for Linux (specifically Kali Linux) and can be run from the command line once downloaded.
Run "python [insert tool name here] -h" to get information on how best to use the tool.

Please let me know if there is anything unclear about any of them, and I can work to make changes and updates to make them more functional.
